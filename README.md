# DnDCharacterSheets`
A place to upload the character sheets we have created and share them out easily for editing. 

Due to google drive likes to strip the HTML off the end and convert it to a DOCX filled with tables and stip out importatnt info, im uploading all of this info to GH for easy consumation!

These are Character Sheets in HTML Format created useing the Character Creation page from wizards 3.5 page. (Ill link to it later). 

This is currently missing 1 players character sheet due to it was not saved locally, that will be fixed soon.
